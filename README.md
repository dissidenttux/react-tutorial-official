# React Tutorial Official
This "tic-tac-toe" game project is a product of the [*Intro to React* tutorial listed in the official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#storing-a-history-of-moves), which teaches how React works, going over concepts like:
- The definition of React
- The fundamentals of React (e.x. components, props, and state)
- The most common techniques of React development
- The identification and utilization of React's strengths

The project itself brings these features to the end-user:
- Play tic-tac-toe on the browser,
- Indicates when a player has won,
- Stores the game's history as it progresses,
- Allows players to review the game's history and see previous versions of a game session's board.
